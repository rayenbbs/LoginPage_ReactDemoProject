In this DemoProject, I dove deeper into React hooks, exploring 'useEffect' for handling side effects and 'useReducer' to handle complex states.
Additionally, I utilized React context (context API) and 'useContext' hook to manage global states.
I also learned how to use 'useImperativeHandle' and React.forwardRef to enable passing refs to custom components.
